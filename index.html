        Custom data attributes in HTML follow a specific naming convention: they start with the prefix "data-", followed by any name you choose. For example, "data-selection" is a custom data attribute named "selection".
        
        Custom data attributes are commonly used to store additional data associated with an element, which can then be accessed and manipulated using JavaScript. These attributes are intended for storing data that is not visible or meaningful to the browser, but rather for use by developers.-->
